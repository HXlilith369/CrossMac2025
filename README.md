# CrossMac2025 
The previous version is shown as follows: https://github.com/HXlilith369/cross-Mac

Important Note:For ablation studies, when one modality was removed (e.g., audio or vision), the remaining cross-modal paths were symmetrically adjusted to ensure structural comparability across models. This ensures that the number of attention paths and the concatenation strategy remain consistent with the full model setup.

The released code is intended for reproducing the results reported in our paper "CrossMAC: Cross-Modal Attention Contrastive Mechanism for Enhanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis". All hyperparameters used in the code are consistent with those described in the paper.
