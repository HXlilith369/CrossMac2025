# CrossMac2025 
The previous version is shown as follows: https://github.com/HXlilith369/cross-Mac

Important Note:For ablation studies, when one modality was removed (e.g., audio or vision), the remaining cross-modal paths were symmetrically adjusted to ensure structural comparability across models. This ensures that the number of attention paths and the concatenation strategy remain consistent with the full model setup.
